# Gif In Console

This is a project that I made because I saw a tweet about a gif being played on the command line. [Link to the tweet](https://twitter.com/github/status/1007696362576728064).
This inspired me to try and create such an application myself. 

## Set-up

Basically all you need to do is `dotnet restore`  
This install the dependencies needed to run this project.

## Other details

this project is hosted on my [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/limecta/gif-in-console) and [Github](https://github.com/bryankroesbeek/gif-in-console). :)
